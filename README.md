# worldLinkPrediction

The goal of this project is to reproduce results found in an analysis of global trade networks using an exponential random graph model (ERGM) and then compare the results with more reliable methods using gradient boosting, or GCNs.
We will also be implimenting novel metrics to input into the GCN.

## Goals:
•	How do results using boosting algorithms to identify important features compare to ERGM results?
•	What features impact static trade relationships in the global trade network?
•	What features impact dynamic trade relationships in the global trade network?
•	How localized are trade relationships versus global trade relationships?
•	How do novel metrics influence model predictions?
•	Stretch: Investigate how tariffs impact trade relations. 
•	Stretch: Is income inequality an indicator of temporal or static trade relations?
